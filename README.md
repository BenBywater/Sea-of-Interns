# Sea-of-Interns
Release build

This is a small text based adventure created to enhance my Game Software Engineering application to Rare.

Each time the game is played, randomly generated stats and pirate title will be given to the player. 

This is akin to Dungeons and Dragons where the player must make skill checks to proceed in the story, so choose carefully!

The game takes around 5 minutes to play. Enjoy!
